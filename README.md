Creating a word guess game using javascript, html and css.

### How you solved it:

### Technical approach:
 I first figured out that I needed to create variables and then call those variables in various functions. 

### What the project does: 
This is a word guess game about guessing an animal word. The number of letters will be displayed and ther will guess by typing in a letter. If the letter is not in the word then the letter will be marked in letters guessed. If the letter is not correct the number of remaining guesses decreases. If you guess the letter correctly you win and the game will start over again.
